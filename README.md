### Notable Code Snippets

#### 1. Client Management Example

The `ClienteDao.java` class provides data access operations for the `Cliente` model.

```java
public class ClienteDao {
    private Connection connection;

    public ClienteDao() {
        this.connection = new Conexion().getConnection();
    }

    public boolean registrarCliente(Cliente cliente) {
        String query = "INSERT INTO clientes (dni, nombre, direccion, telefono) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
        try (PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(query)) {
            stmt.setString(1, cliente.getDni());
            stmt.setString(2, cliente.getNombre());
            stmt.setString(3, cliente.getDireccion());
            stmt.setString(4, cliente.getTelefono());
            stmt.executeUpdate();
            return true;
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return false;
        }
    }

    // Additional CRUD operations...
}
```

#### 2. Sales Reporting Example

The `Grafico.java` class is responsible for generating graphical reports of sales data.

```java
public class Grafico {
    public static void generarReporteVentas(List<Venta> ventas) {
        DefaultCategoryDataset dataset = new DefaultCategoryDataset();
        for (Venta venta : ventas) {
            dataset.addValue(venta.getTotal(), "Ventas", venta.getFecha());
        }

        JFreeChart chart = ChartFactory.createBarChart(
            "Reporte de Ventas",
            "Fecha",
            "Total",
            dataset,
            PlotOrientation.VERTICAL,
            false, true, false
        );

        ChartFrame frame = new ChartFrame("Reporte de Ventas", chart);
        frame.pack();
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```

### Principal Document: ProyectoFinal_IS23.pdf

The [ProyectoFinal_IS23.pdf](ProyectoFinal_IS23.pdf) document provides the main context and problem statement that led to the development of this project, "Gestión de Clientes y Productos de Elena (SGCP-E)". Key points from the document include:

-   **Business Background**: Elena runs an aromatherapy business that has been managed manually. With the increasing number of clients, she decided to automate her business operations.
-   **Client Management**: The system needs to handle a continuously growing client database, storing information such as registration date, full name, address, email, phone numbers, birthday, ailments (e.g., headaches, joint pain, allergies), occupation, hobbies, and how the client was met.
-   **Product Management**: The system must track products purchased by clients, including purchase date, estimated product duration, and client feedback.
-   **Notifications and Alerts**: Automatic notifications are required to remind clients to repurchase products nearing the end of their estimated duration. Reports should be generated for products on promotion, and notifications should be sent for client birthdays.
-   **Promotions and Reports**: Regular promotions (every four weeks) and weekly promotions need detailed reports on clients who have purchased promotional products, including estimated product termination dates for follow-up.
-   **Database and Expansion**: The system should support database scalability to handle data from multiple branches as the business grows.

### Testing Documentation

The [Testing Documentation for the Sistema de Gestión de Clientes y Productos de Elena (SGCP-E)](Pruebas Caja BlancaNegra.pdf) provides an in-depth look into the testing process used to ensure the system's reliability and performance. The document covers:

-   **Black Box Testing**: Focuses on validating the functionality of the system without considering its internal code structure. It verifies that the system behaves as expected based on the provided inputs and the generated outputs.
    -   **Register Product**: Tests the product registration process, ensuring that the system correctly handles both normal and erroneous inputs.
    -   **Register Client**: Tests the client registration process, validating that the system correctly manages complete and incomplete data entries.
-   **White Box Testing**: Examines the internal workings of the system's code to ensure that all possible execution paths are tested.
    -   **Code Coverage**: Ensures that all lines of code and logical paths are exercised during testing.
    -   **Test Case Design**: Based on the detailed knowledge of the internal structure of the code.

The testing documentation highlights the importance of both black box and white box testing methods to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the system's functionality, performance, and reliability. It includes specific test cases, expected outcomes, actual outcomes, and detailed steps for reproducing any identified issues.
